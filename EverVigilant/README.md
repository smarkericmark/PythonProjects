Proof of Concept for a dicsord dice roller speicific to an RPG my friend made called "Ever Vigilant"

Basically you roll six sided dice and 5's and 6's are successes
However you can also push rolls that make other numbers count as successes, there is then a fatigue check

This program handles all of that. 

See the Discord Bot for the Final Version.
